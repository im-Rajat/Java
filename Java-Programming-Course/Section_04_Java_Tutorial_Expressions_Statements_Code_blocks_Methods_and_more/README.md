# Section 4: Java Tutorial: Expressions, Statements, Code blocks, Methods and more


## Control Flow: `if`, `else if`, `else`

These statements are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions.

  * **Indentation is Important**: Proper indentation makes code much more readable, especially within control flow blocks.

-----

## Methods (Functions)

  * **Methods** in Java are similar to functions in other programming languages. They are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program.
  * **Tool Tip**: You can use software like **DiffMerge** to compare 2 files or folders, which is helpful for tracking changes in your code.

-----

## Method Overloading

**Method overloading** is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, as long as their parameter lists are different (i.e., they have different numbers or types of arguments).

  * It is considered **good practice** to use method overloading where appropriate.
  * It improves code **readability** and **re-usability**.

## Defining a Constant in Java

A **constant** is a variable whose value cannot be changed after it has been assigned. You can define one in Java using the `static` and `final` keywords.

```java
public static final String INVALID_VALUE_MESSAGE = "Invalid Value";
```
