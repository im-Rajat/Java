## About JavaFX

**JavaFX** is a set of Java APIs used to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Java applications. It is a collection of Java packages and is the modern successor to **Swing**, which was Java's previous UI toolkit.


We can create UI components either programmatically with Java code or declaratively using **FXML**. Using FXML to define the user interface is considered a best practice as it cleanly separates the application logic from the UI design.
